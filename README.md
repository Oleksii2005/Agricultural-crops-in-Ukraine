 This study analyzed the production volumes, yields, and area of crops by species as of August 1, 2025. This analysis included the most widely grown crops in Ukraine and a comparison of the contribution of the country's regions to the total volume of products grown. The most widely grown agricultural product in Ukraine (for the first half of 2025) was wheat, whose share in the total volume of production is 66.1% (see Figure 1)

 For many years, wheat has remained the main and dominant crop in the economy of Ukraine. That is why its yield is of extreme importance, both for the country's internal food supply and for economic relations with other states that are importers of Ukrainian wheat. In this regard, at this stage it is important to focus on wheat, having analyzed its production indicators and dynamics in detail. Only after that can we proceed to the study of other agricultural crops, which also occupy a significant place in the structure of agricultural production in Ukraine and are an integral part of its economic potential. In recent years, Ukraine has faced a number of unforeseen problems that have changed the volume of wheat cultivation and the size of the harvested areas. Therefore, we will consider in detail which regions of Ukraine harvested the largest area with wheat in the 1st half of 2025. And we will be able to analyze and say in which part of Ukraine the cultivation of agricultural products is most developed (See Figure 2).

 <p align="center"><img width="500" height="1300" alt="dependence" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46851e1a-d5c9-4141-894e-548a755aa703" /> </p>



As we can see, the leader among the regions in terms of the size of the harvested area is Odesa region. Thus, the harvested area is 681.1 thousand hectares, which is equal to 6,811 kmÂ² and is 20.44% of the total area of the region (33,314 kmÂ²). This can be explained by the quality of the soils in this area, this territory is more fertile compared to others. This fact can also be confirmed by other regions that made it to the top ten, because among them 8 regions are located in the Southern and Central parts of Ukraine. As for other regions of Ukraine, it should be noted that their significant lag behind the leaders is caused by both military events (Eastern Ukraine) and a significant share of mountainous terrain where the soil is not intended for growing agricultural products in large quantities (Western Ukraine, the Carpathian Mountains). If we return to the leader of Ukraine, namely the Odessa region, it is important to remember that currently this is the only region of Ukraine that has practically free access to the Black Sea, which is the largest logistical route for exporting Ukrainian grain, therefore placing large harvested areas near such a logistical route is logical.

If we return to the leader of Ukraine, namely the Odessa region, it is important to remember that currently this is the only region of Ukraine that has practically free access to the Black Sea, which is the largest logistical route for exporting Ukrainian grain, therefore placing large harvested areas near such a logistical route is logical. Odesa region also has a favorable climate for growing winter wheat - a sufficient number of sunny days and relatively warm winters. This makes the region more stable in yield compared to northern or western regions. It follows that based on the cultivated area in Ukraine, a number of regions can be clearly distinguished that form the basis of the national grain potential. And now we should analyze whether the harvested area is related to the volume of wheat production (see Figure 3).

Based on this image, it can be stated that with an increase in area, the volume of harvested wheat increases. This indicates a direct relationship between these indicators, which can also be verified by calculating the correlation, but from this graph you can already trace this relationship and understand that the correlation will be close to 1. Also, from Figure 3, we can see that there are regions in Ukraine that stand out significantly from the others. And most regions have the same indicators (significantly lower than the leading regions). Now let's see if there are any changes in the leaderboard among the regions of Ukraine in terms of the volume of harvested crops (see Figure 4).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="vol_production_wheat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e55a0748-180b-42a3-bb29-dd987fb21605" /></p>


Based on the obtained graph, we can state that Odesa region remains the absolute leader both in terms of sown area and volume of harvested crop. Other regions, the leaders have changed somewhat, for example: Kirovohrad region took 2nd place, which indicates a higher average yield per hectare of land than Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions; Poltava region became higher in the rating than Kharkiv region, probably due to the presence of black soil in Poltava region, as the most fertile type of soil; Chernihiv region also entered the top 10 rating, replacing Zaporizhia region. But, despite this, the trend has persisted and the leaders are mainly regions of Central and Southern Ukraine.

Conclusion: Wheat plays a crucial role in the development of Ukrainian agriculture and its economic potential. Thus, wheat accounts for 66% of all harvested agricultural products, and Odessa became the leader among the regions, both in terms of the size of the harvested area and the volume of the harvested crop. The leadership of the Odessa region and the regions of the Southern part of Ukraine is explained by more fertile soils and proximity to the Black Sea, as the largest logistics route of Ukraine.

<p align="center">ðŸŒ¿BARLEYðŸŒ¿</p>

Now let's talk about barley, which ranks second among agricultural products in Ukraine in the first half of 2025, accounting for 18.9% of the total (see Figure 5). It is important in the food industry, where it is used to produce cereals, flour, coffee substitutes and traditional kvass. Barley also plays an important role in brewing, as it is the main raw material for the production of malt. Barley is also used in feed production (as a valuable animal feed) and for medical purposes (decoctions and infusions have anti-inflammatory and enveloping properties).

<p align ="center"><img width="500" height="1593" alt="barley" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/365079b7-2fcb-498a-9fc0-74d330a070be" /></p>


At the next stage, it is important to analyze whether there is a certain pattern between the leading regions and types of agricultural products. In particular, we are interested in the question: do the regions that occupy leading positions in wheat cultivation coincide with those that are leaders in barley production, or are there significant differences between these indicators. Such an analysis makes it possible to understand to what extent the specialization of regions in grain production is stable and whether certain regions are determined by universal leaders, capable of providing significant volumes of several crops at once. At the same time, regional features can also be identified: for example, regions where agroclimatic conditions are more favorable specifically for wheat, or vice versa - for barley (see Figure 6).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="harvested_area_barley" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e31e3b2e-95c3-48b9-bd79-3fdc61805c29" /></p>


Overall, the studied rating for barley is almost the same as the similar indicator for wheat. So the first 4 regions remained unchanged, Odesa region remains the absolute leader with a large gap from the second place. But Donetsk region got into the top ten, which indicates its focus on barley as the driving force of the agricultural potential of the region. Now let's analyze whether these leaders coincide with the leaders in the amount of barley harvested (see Figure 7).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="vol_production_barley" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ff38389-4dd0-4c1a-af12-2539f05150d8" /></p>


Conclusion: In general, the trend of the largest harvested areas remained unchanged for barley, and the leaders are the regions of Southern and Central Ukraine. However, the top ten regions in terms of harvested volume included two regions from the Western part of Ukraine, namely Ternopil and Khmelnytsky. This may indicate the orientation of these regions to barley and the suitability of the soil in these areas for growing barley.

<p align="center">ðŸŒ±RAPESEEDðŸŒ±</p>

Winter and spring rapeseed (colza) are multifunctional oilseed crops, the seeds of which are used to produce oil used in the food industry (margarine, mayonnaise), for the production of lubricants and biofuels. By-products of processing - meal and cake - are valuable animal feed. Both types of rapeseed, as well as their green mass, are good siderates for soil improvement and weed control. Spring rapeseed also serves as an "insurance" crop, which is sown if winter rapeseed freezes, and as a honey plant that attracts bees. In general, rapeseed ranks 3rd among the most grown agricultural products and occupies 10.6% of the total volume (see Figure 9)

<p align="center"><img width="500" height="1645" alt="harvested_area_rapeseed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71ac05fa-366f-4421-b972-e746c9d0b8dc" /></p>


We will now continue the analysis and apply the same algorithm that we have already used for wheat and barley. This will allow us to maintain consistency in the study and follow a single logic. Our next step will be to consider the regions where rapeseed is grown. We will analyze the acreage and production volumes of this crop and check whether the target regions for rapeseed differ from those that were leaders in the cultivation of wheat and barley. This approach will help determine whether there are consistent patterns in regional specialization or whether different production centers are observed for different crops (see Figure 10).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="harvested_area_rapeseed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2892ddc0-03b4-479e-94f4-63932217a9e2" /></p>



Oddly enough, the leaders remain Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, but it can be seen that for both barley and rapeseed, many regions from Western and Northern Ukraine are among the top ten. That is, we can conclude that the harvested area is spread across all parts of the country without a specific concentration of these areas in a certain part of Ukraine. A similar trend is observed for the volume of harvested crops (see Figure 11).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="vol_production_rapeseed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf67cb9-760c-4cf0-a63f-26b091ea17f1" /></p>


Conclusion: From the analysis of rapeseed cultivation in the 1st half of 2025 in Ukraine, it follows that this type of crop is not characterized by concentration in a certain part of the country, that is, in general, rapeseed cultivation is widespread throughout the territory of Ukraine. However, it should be noted that rapeseed is grown in much smaller quantities compared to wheat and barley, which may affect the overall difference between the regions of the Southern part of Ukraine and other regions, since the areas in the Southern and Central parts of the country are sown mainly with wheat and barley as the most important crops for the existence of Ukraine.

<p align="center">ðŸŸ¢LEGUMINOUS CROPSðŸŸ¢</p>

Legumes are needed to improve soil fertility, as they enrich it with nitrogen, and are also a valuable source of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals for humans and animals. They are used in nutrition, as livestock feed, for green manure, and in folk medicine. In total, legumes account for 3.1% of the total crop volume. For Ukraine, 93% of legume crops consist of peas, and it is also distributed mainly only in the Central and Southern parts of Ukraine, like wheat (see Figure 12).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="harvested_area_leguminous_crops" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5279426-4b0a-43bf-8522-dc2c833330be" /></p>


It is clear that the volume of the harvested crop also has a similar trend, with only some changes between the regions that made it to the top ten. It can be seen that no region from the Western part of Ukraine made it to the top ten, which may indicate a certain backwardness in the cultivation of legumes compared to other regions of Ukraine (see Figure 13).

<p align="center"><img width="700" height="1645" alt="vol_production_leguminous_crops" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca3488e-2a8b-4814-a5d9-16422ce934ef" /></p>


Conclusion: For legumes, the situation is identical to that for wheat, i.e. the largest volumes of harvested crops are located practically only in the Southern and Central regions of Ukraine. As we indicated earlier, this is due to soil fertility, crop specificity, and the proximity of the regions to the largest logistics routes of Ukraine.
